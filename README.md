*Source Files*

We model each kit in SolidWorks. To access the parametric source files, download the *AKER - V Planter-Large - v1.0.zip* file and then establish local file references following this video: [AKER - Parametric Models](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ewdrlv4nSA0). You can then adjust the model dimensions using the external *Equations.txt* file.

The **V Planter-Large** was modeled using our updated 2016 modeling workflow, which provides a wider range of options than our 2015 process. This source file pack has DXFs in the following formats:

 * 0.5 inch material & 0.375 inch tool or smaller
 * 0.75 inch material & 0.375 inch tool or smaller
 * 12 mm material & 10 mm tool or smaller
 * 18 mm material & 10 mm tool or smaller

*Nesting Layout*
